# Coding workflow preferences

## Approach: Always aim for a clean, maintainable architecture that favors security, durability, and consistency.

- Focus on areas of the code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code unrelated to the task
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
