# Packages Split Commits Rule

## Overview
This rule ensures proper commit structure for the packages directory to maintain semantic-release compatibility in a monorepo setup.

## Critical Requirements

### 1. **Separate Commits Per Package**
When making changes that affect multiple packages, create separate commits for each package:

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Single commit affecting multiple packages
git commit -m "feat: add new feature to both pp-dev and create-pp-dev"

# ✅ CORRECT - Separate commits per package
git commit -m "feat(pp-dev): add new authentication middleware"
git commit -m "feat(create-pp-dev): update templates with new auth feature"
```

### 2. **Package-Specific Commit Messages**
Use the package name as the scope in commit messages:

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT examples
feat(pp-dev): add new CLI command
fix(create-pp-dev): resolve template generation issue
docs(pp-dev): update API documentation
chore(create-pp-dev): update dependencies
```

### 3. **File Path Considerations**
When committing changes, be specific about which package is affected:

```bash
# For pp-dev changes
git add packages/pp-dev/
git commit -m "feat(pp-dev): your message"

# For create-pp-dev changes
git add packages/create-pp-dev/
git commit -m "feat(create-pp-dev): your message"

# For template changes
git add packages/create-pp-dev/template-*/
git commit -m "feat(create-pp-dev): update template configurations"
```

## Why This Matters

### Semantic Release Monorepo Behavior
- **semantic-release-monorepo** analyzes commits per package
- Each package gets its own version bump based on its specific commits
- Mixed commits can cause incorrect version calculations
- Package-specific commits ensure accurate changelog generation

### Version Bump Logic
- `feat(pp-dev):` → triggers MINOR version bump for pp-dev
- `fix(create-pp-dev):` → triggers PATCH version bump for create-pp-dev
- Mixed commits may cause unexpected version bumps

## Package Structure

### Current Packages
- **pp-dev**: Core development tool (`packages/pp-dev/`)
- **create-pp-dev**: Template generator (`packages/create-pp-dev/`)

### Template Dependencies
When updating template files, ensure the parent package is also updated:
```bash
# Update template files
git add packages/create-pp-dev/template-*/
git commit -m "feat(create-pp-dev): update template dependencies"

# Update main package.json if needed
git add packages/create-pp-dev/package.json
git commit -m "chore(create-pp-dev): update pp-dev dependency version"
```

## Commit Message Format

### Required Format
```
<type>(<package>): <subject>
```

### Valid Types
- `feat` - New features (MINOR version bump)
- `fix` - Bug fixes (PATCH version bump)
- `docs` - Documentation changes (NO version bump)
- `style` - Code style changes (NO version bump)
- `refactor` - Code refactoring (NO version bump)
- `perf` - Performance improvements (NO version bump)
- `test` - Adding/updating tests (NO version bump)
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks (NO version bump)
- `ci` - CI/CD changes (NO version bump)
- `build` - Build system changes (NO version bump)

### Valid Package Scopes
- `pp-dev` - Changes to the pp-dev package
- `create-pp-dev` - Changes to the create-pp-dev package

## Examples

### ✅ Good Examples
```bash
feat(pp-dev): add new authentication middleware
fix(pp-dev): resolve memory leak in data processing
docs(pp-dev): update installation instructions
chore(create-pp-dev): update all template dependencies
feat(create-pp-dev): add new Next.js template variant
```

### ❌ Bad Examples
```bash
feat: add new feature to both packages
fix: resolve issues in pp-dev and create-pp-dev
chore: update dependencies
feat(pp-dev,create-pp-dev): add new feature
```

## Workflow Integration

### Release Process
1. Make package-specific commits
2. Push to appropriate branch (main for stable, develop for beta)
3. semantic-release-monorepo analyzes each package independently
4. Each package gets versioned based on its own commit history
5. GitHub Actions workflow publishes packages separately

### Branch Strategy
- **main**: Stable releases (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.)
- **develop**: Beta releases (v1.1.0-beta.1, v1.1.0-beta.2, etc.)

## Enforcement

### Pre-commit Hooks
Consider adding pre-commit hooks to enforce this rule:
```bash
# Check if commit affects multiple packages
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E '^packages/' | cut -d'/' -f2 | sort -u | wc -l | grep -v '^1$'; then
  echo "Error: Commit affects multiple packages. Please split into separate commits."
  exit 1
fi
```

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Each commit affects only one package
- [ ] Commit message includes correct package scope
- [ ] No mixed changes across packages in single commit
- [ ] Template changes are committed with create-pp-dev scope
